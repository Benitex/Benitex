I'm Benito, aka Benitex on the internet. Here, on my profile page, you can check out my personal projects (mainly games) and exercises I made during high school and university in Brazil (although some of this content is only available in Portuguese 😟). Thank you for your interest in my profile, and I hope you can have fun and learn something here!
