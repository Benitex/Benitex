## Hi, I'm Benito, welcome!

My name is Benito, but you may also know me by the nickname Benitex. Welcome to my profile page, enjoy checking out my personal projects! If you have suggestions, ideas or just want to talk about one them, feel free to contact me on any of my social accounts.

If you don't know where to start, here's a breakdown of the projects I've been working on:

* **Vulturis** is the game I'm working on right now. It's a metroidvania in which you can transform into any enemy and use their special abilities to explore the map, according to the forms you've unlocked.
* [Pokemon Burning Scales](https://github.com/Benitex/Pokemon-Burning-Scales) is a Pokemon fan game I've been working on since 2020, it's a narrative-driven game focused on side quests and the freedom to explore the game on your own terms.
* [Automatic Level Scaling](https://github.com/Benitex/Automatic-Level-Scaling) is a Pokemon Essentials plugin that automatically scales and evolves trainer and wild pokemon levels to the player party levels. This plugin is being used (in many different ways) in multiple Pokemon fan games developed by the community.
* [Echoes of the Rainforest](https://poteiga.itch.io/echoes-of-the-rainforest) is a top-down action RPG game about preservation, colonialism, and folklore. The story takes place in a fantasy setting inspired by Brazilian history and folklore, taking on its themes and characters.

As you can see, I am very passionate about making games. But if you're interested in something else, you can check out:

* [Maraca Map](https://github.com/Benitex/Maraca-Map), a virtual map app developed to guide people through the Maracan√£ region (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), showing possible points of interest, such as restaurants, schools, and public transportation points. In addition, the app seeks to assist physically disabled people walking in the region, by indicating ramps and points with obstacles in the way.
* [Programming Exercises](https://github.com/Benitex/Exercicios) I did during high school and university, including topics such as object oriented programming, data structures, web and game development principles.

Also, here are some other short games I have worked on:

* [Steam Rails](https://benitex.itch.io/steam-rails) is a roguelike in which up to three players can explore an infinite steampunk-themed train, fighting monsters and getting stronger after each room, by collecting weapons and items on the way.
* [Slap Simulator](https://silentraccoon.itch.io/slap-simulator) is a comedy game made for Global Game Jam 2024. In this game, you're the bouncer of a party and you decide whether you allow characters to enter or not (slaping them away), according to their characteristics.
* [Circulating](https://benitex.itch.io/circulating) is a simple game about circles going in circles. The player's goal is to escape from a circle that follows the mouse, which gets faster and bigger every second. You can also change the difficulty by buying items from a store, which can make the game easier or harder, depending on your strategy.
* [Space Infinite War](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/559639746/) is the first game I ever made. It's a local multiplayer game in which the player aims to defeat the opponent's spaceship by hitting it with shots. The ships are inspired by Marvel characters, and there are ten options to choose from.
