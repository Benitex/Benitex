| [Circulating](https://benitex.itch.io/circulating) is a simple game about circles going in circles. The player's goal is to escape from a circle that follows the mouse, which gets faster and bigger every second. You can also change the difficulty by buying items from a store, which can make the game easier or harder, depending on your strategy. | [Space Infinite War](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/559639746/) is the first game I ever made. It's a local multiplayer game in which the player aims to defeat the opponent's spaceship by hitting it with shots. The ships are inspired by Marvel characters, and there are ten options to choose from. |
